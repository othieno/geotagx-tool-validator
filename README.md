[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geotagx/geotagx-tool-validator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geotagx/geotagx-tool-validator)

The project validator is a command line tool used to validate GeoTag-X project configurations as per the [technical specification](https://github.com/geotagx/geotagx-documentation/specification.CONFIGURATIONS.md).
